# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the application architecture and design decisions.

## Project Structure

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
├── app/                    # Next.js app router pages
│   ├── about/             # About page route
│   ├── contact/           # Contact page route
│   ├── globals.css        # Global styles
│   ├── layout.tsx         # Root layout
│   └── page.tsx           # Home page
├── components/            # Reusable React components
│   ├── common/            # Shared components (Header, Footer)
│   ├── sections/          # Layout sections

├── utils/                 # Utility functions

```

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- UI components are separated from business logic
- Presentational components are separated from container components
- Shared utilities are separated from page-specific logic

### 2. Reusability

- Components are designed to be reusable across the application
- Utilities are generic and can be used in multiple contexts
- Configuration is centralized for easy maintenance

### 3. Scalability

- Modular architecture allows for easy expansion
- Component-based design enables parallel development
- Clear folder structure supports team collaboration

## Component Architecture

### UI Components (`components/ui/`)

- Pure presentation components
- No business logic
- Highly customizable through props
- Following consistent design system

### Common Components (`components/common/`)

- Layout components used across pages
- Navigation elements
- Shared structural components

### Feature Components (`components/features/`)

- Business logic specific components
- Interaction with services/api
- State management within feature boundary

## Data Flow

The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. Components receive data through props
2. User actions trigger event handlers
3. State updates happen through React state or context
4. Updated state causes component re-rendering

## Error Handling

- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for data integrity
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Centralized error logging for debugging
